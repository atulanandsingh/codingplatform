Abstract
This web document is an effort to combine the information about competitive coding websites on a single platform. Along with which it provides information about all the events (technical and non-technical) happening in the different colleges. 

Description
Coding Platform, is an attempt to present the wide amount of coding competition events and other events happening in our college and university and other colleges, on a common and easy to reach platform. Although there exists different websites providing data regarding events happening online and offline, but the information is present in a very scattered manner. With this website we are making an attempt to show all the important events information a college student may need on a single platform.
Coding Platform combines the events information from different competitive coding website, our college website, our university website and many other colleges and educational platforms websites. It combines those data and provide user a simplistic view of all the events. It also provides students the link to problems related to computer programming field categorized on different difficulty level to provide easy selection and assessment.
During college days every student finds difficulty in implementing and attempting computer programming problems. Merely understanding the theory doesnâ€™t helps when its comes to solve the problem. And so it is believed that solving more and more problems is a better approach. As there exists many platforms which provide facility for competitive computer programming which is believed to be one of the best way to improve programming skills, students often get confused on which platform to choose and also they tend to miss many useful and interesting coding events because of a number of websites. In coding platform the collective information of all the websites is shown, so that students miss no events happening online on any of the major websites of his/her choice. Also there is no medium available to know about the offline events happening in different colleges around, which can also be a great way of learning and meeting with new peoples of common interests. Thus coding platform brings information about all the offline events happening in all known colleges and universities around in Delhi.
