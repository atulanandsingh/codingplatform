Abstract

This web document is an effort to combine the information about competitive coding websites on a single platform. Along with which it provides information about all the events (technical and non-technical) happening in the college and universities in contact. 

Description

Data Structures and Algorithm lays the foundation of Computer Science. As merely studying the concepts won't make you perfect in implementing them in real, for that you need to practise. There exists multiple websites which provide you contents for studying different platform along with websites hosting different events as a form of competition. Competing is one the best way to improve yourself.
But in today's scenario there are multiple platform and these information is scattered. This website is an approach to display all the necessary and important information provided by those websites together on an easy to browse design.
Here you can check the events hosted on multiple websites. Practise problems of different difficulty level on different platforms. Learn about different techniques of problem solving and different approach to solve problems. Also you can raise your questions and issues by contacting us.
